# Notes
Game Client, game server,

first create a singly player one with interest in network 

once you move the last position will be moved into the position wanting to be moved 

before you do a collion look at a bounding box is and check if players head is in that box which would allow for quicker removal 

function detect collison 

we need to make sure that the player is always moving
